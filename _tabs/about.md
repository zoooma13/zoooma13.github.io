### Hello and welcome to my blog! 

I'm Hazem Issa, a second-year computer science major at KAIST. This blog is a personal project I've been looking forward to for a while. Here, I gather the tasks I've created for programming competitions and share their solutions along with insights on how to approach them.

### Who is this intended to?

Basically, anyone fond of problem solving and algorithms will find a problem here that piques their interest. The tasks vary in difficulty, ranging from d2A's to d1D's in terms of codeforces ratings.

### Where were this tasks published?

* [International Olympiad in Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/)
* [European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics](https://egoi.org/)
* [KAIST RUN (Spring and ICPC Mock Contest)](https://kaist.run/en/)
* [Egyptian Olympiad in Informatics](https://www.eoi.eg/)
* [Codechef.com](https://www.codechef.com/)

For more details, you can find the tasks published in each competition in the [categories](../categories) tab.

### Want to chat?

Feel free to [email](mailto:hazemt61@gmail.com) me.
