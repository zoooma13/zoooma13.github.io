## Description

### Brief Statement

You are given a single integer $n$. Find the number of cells in [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) that have a value greater than $1$ and less than or equal to $n$. You should answer a total of $t$ such queries.

### Example

When $n = 5$, there are $7$ cells having values between $2$ and $5$ as shown in orange below.

### Constraints

* $1 \le t \le 10^5$
* $2 \le n \le 10^{16}$

### Subtasks

1. (8 points) $n \le 50$
2. (16 points) $n \le 10^3$
3. (19 points) $n \le 10^5$
4. (29 points) $n \le 10^9$
5. (28 points) No additional constraints

## Solution

### Subtask #1 ($n \le 50$)

After looking at Pascal's triangle, you can immediately notice that there aren't that many cells with values less than $50$. Also, you can observe that the second cell and the cell before the last in each row are always equal to the row number. However, only a few numbers appear in Pascal's triangle that are not on the mentioned cells. Consequently, we can just hardcode these values into the solution. For details, refer to the code below.

```cpp
int count(int n)
{
    int c = 2 - (n == 2);
    if(n == 6)  c += 1;
    if(n == 10) c += 2;
    if(n == 15) c += 2;
    if(n == 20) c += 1;
    if(n == 21) c += 2;
    if(n == 28) c += 2;
    if(n == 35) c += 2;
    if(n == 36) c += 2;
    if(n == 45) c += 2;
    return c;
}

void solve()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int ans = 0;
    for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        ans += count(i);
    printf("%d\n",ans);
}
```

### Subtask #2 ($n \le 10^3$)

In this subtask, we can simply precompute Pascal's triangle for the first $n$ rows in $O(n^2)$ time and memory, then, count the cells with values less than or equal to $n$, and store the answers in an array for all $n \le 10^3$. Note that, we need to be careful with overflows since numbers get rather large quickly.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
const int MAXN = 1003;

int answer[MAXN];
int c[MAXN][MAXN] = { {1} };

void precompute()
{
    for(int i = 1; i < MAXN; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j <= i; j++){
            c[i][j] = j? c[i-1][j-1] + c[i-1][j] : 1;
            c[i][j] = min(c[i][j] ,MAXN+1); //to avoid overflows
            if(1 < c[i][j] && c[i][j] < MAXN)
                answer[c[i][j]]++;
        }
    }
    for(int i = 1; i < MAXN; i++)
        answer[i] += answer[i-1];
}

//call `precompute` before any calls to `solve`
void solve()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("%d\n",answer[n]);
}
```
</details>

### Subtask #3 ($n \le 10^5$)

Unlike the last subtask, we cannot precompute the whole triangle since this would consume too much memory and time. Instead, we can exploit the fact that the numbers get large quickly as we go closer to the center. But, how large do they get? 
One way to calculate the value of a cell in Pascal's triangle is by using the [choose function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) $r \choose c$ where $r$ is the row number and $c$ is the column number. When $r = 40$ and $r = 20$, ${r \choose c} = {60 \choose 30} = 1.1 \times 10^{17}$. This implies that:
* ${r \choose 30} \ge 1.1 \times 10^{17}$ for all $r \ge 60$,
* ${r \choose c} \ge 1.1 \times 10^{17}$ for all $r \ge 60$ and $30 \le c \le r - 30$.

This shows that we only care about at most the $30$ first or last cells of a row. So, instead of computing the whole row, we can compute the first and last few cells of each row and ignore the central cells since they're larger than $n$ anyway. This solves the time problem but not the memory one. To save memory, we need to notice that each row depends **only** on the row above it. So, we could just keep track of two rows at any time: the current and the last.

As a result, we have a solution that works in $O(n + t)$ time and $O(n)$ memory.

```cpp
const int MAXN = 100005;

int answer[MAXN];
int c[2][MAXN] = { {1} };

void precompute()
{
    for(int i = 1; i < MAXN; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j <= i/2; j++){ //compute the row from the left
            c[i&1][j] = j? c[i&1^1][j-1] + c[i&1^1][j] : 1;
            c[i&1][j] = min(c[i&1][j] ,MAXN+1); //to avoid overflows
            if(c[i&1][j] > MAXN) //stop once the numbers get too large
                break;
            answer[c[i&1][j]]++;
        }
        for(int j = i; j > i/2; j--){ //compute the row from the right
            c[i&1][j] = j? c[i&1^1][j-1] + c[i&1^1][j] : 1;
            c[i&1][j] = min(c[i&1][j] ,MAXN+1); //to avoid overflows
            if(c[i&1][j] > MAXN) //stop once the numbers get too large
                break;
            answer[c[i&1][j]]++;
        }
    }
    answer[1] = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i < MAXN; i++)
        answer[i] += answer[i-1];
}

//call `precompute` before any calls to `solve`
void solve()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("%d\n",answer[n]);
}
```

### Subtask #4 ($n \le 10^9$)

From subtask 1, we saw that each integer $n > 2$ appears in Pascal's triangle at least twice, on the first and $(r-1)$-st cells of the $r$-th row. We can exploit this fact by ignoring those two cells when computing the triangle, and accounting for them by a simple equation in the end: $2n - 3$ is the total number of cells, with values less than $n$, that are lying on the $1$-st or $(r-1)$-st cells of the $r$-th row. Convince yourself by looking at the picture in the [exmple](#example) above.

To recap, we are computing the triangle and ignoring the $1$-st and $(r-1)$-st cells of the $r$-th row. When do we halt the loop in this case? Previously, we stopped at the $n$-th row but now we only care about the values on the $2$-nd and $(r-2)$-nd cells of the $r$-th row, which are equal ${r \choose 2} = {r \choose n-2} = \frac{r(r-1)}{2} \approx r^2$. This means that we are halting at $r \approx \sqrt n$ and computing at most $30$ cells on each row.

Unlike the previous subtasks, we cannot keep a frequency array for the answer. Instead, we will store all the values of the computed cells in a sorted list $P$. Then, for each query, we will do a binary search on the latest index $x$ such that $P_x \le n$, the answer is then $x + 2n - 3$.

As a result, we have a solution that works in $O(\sqrt n + t \log \sqrt n)$ time and $O(\sqrt n)$ memory.

```cpp
const int MAXN = 1e9;
 
int row[2][30];
vector <int> all;

void precompute()
{
    for(int n = 1; row[n&1][2] <= MAXN; n++){
        for(int k = 0; 2*k <= n; k++){
            int cell = k? row[n&1][k-1] + row[n&1][k] : 1;
            row[~n&1][k] = min(MAXN+1 ,cell);
            row[~n&1][k+1] = min(MAXN+1 ,cell);
            if(cell > MAXN)
                break;
            if(k > 1){
                all.push_back(cell);
                if(n != 2*k)
                    all.push_back(cell);
            }
        }
    }
    sort(all.begin() ,all.end());
}

//call `precompute` before any calls to `solve`
void solve()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("%I64d\n",upper_bound(all.begin() ,all.end() ,n) - all.begin() + 2LL*n-3);
}
```
</details>

### Subtask #5 (Full solution)

Extending the approach from last subtask, we can ignore the $2$-nd and $(r-2)$-nd cells of the $r$-th row when calculating the triangle, and account for them using a formula. This can be done by doing a binary search for the largest value of $r$ such that ${r \choose 2} \le n$, then adding $2r - 7$ to the answer.

We halt the loop once the value of ${r \choose 3} = {r \choose r-3} = \frac{r(r-1)(r-2)}{6} \approx r^3$ is greater than $10^{16}$. Thus, we calculate at most $30$ cells of each row up to $r \approx \sqrt[3]{n}$.

As a result, we have a solution that works in $O(\sqrt[3]{n} + t \log \sqrt n)$ time and $O(\sqrt[3]{n})$ memory.

const int64_t MAXN = 1e16;

int64_t row[2][30];
vector <int64_t> all;

        for(int k = 0; 2*k <= n; k++){
            int64_t cell = k? row[n&1][k-1] + row[n&1][k] : 1;
            row[~n&1][k] = min(MAXN+1 ,cell);
            row[~n&1][k+1] = min(MAXN+1 ,cell);
            if(cell > MAXN)
                break;
            if(k > 2){
                all.push_back(cell);
                if(n != 2*k)
                    all.push_back(cell);
            }
        }
    }
    sort(all.begin() ,all.end());
}

//call `precompute` before any calls to `solve`
void solve()
{
    int64_t n;
    scanf("%I64d",&n);
    
    int64_t l = 1 ,r = 2e9 ,m;
    while(l <= r){
        m = (l+r)/2;
        if(m*(m-1)/2 <= n)
            l = m+1;
        else
            r = m-1;
    }

    int64_t ans = upper_bound(all.begin() ,all.end() ,n) - all.begin();
    ans += max(0LL ,2*n-3);
    ans += max(0LL ,2*r-7);
    printf("%I64d\n",ans);
}
