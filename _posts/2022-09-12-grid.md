## Description

### Brief Statement

You are given three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$. Construct a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns such that:
* Each cell is colored with exactly one color.
* The grid contains exactly $k$ different colors denoted by numbers from $1$ to $k$.
* For each color $i$ $(1 \le i \le k)$, all cells assigned to color $i$ forms a **rectangle**.

In this context, think of a **rectangle** as a shape on the grid that looks like a typical rectangle or a square. More formally, it is a set of cells of the grid $\\{(x, y):a \le x \le c, b \le y \le d \\}$ for some integers $a, b, c, d$ $(1 \le a \le c \le n;$ $1 \le b \le d \le m)$.

### Example

When $n = 4$, $m = 5$, and $k = 6$, we need to color a grid consisting of $4$ rows and $5$ columns with exatly $6$ colors. The following is an example of a valid grid:

```
1 1 4 4 4
3 3 4 4 4
3 3 5 5 2
3 3 5 5 6
```


### Constraints

* $1 \le n, m \le 100$
* $1 \le k \le nm$

### Subtasks

1. (15 points) $n = 1$
2. (23 points) $k = 2$
3. (28 points) $k \le \max(n, m)$
4. (34 points) No additional constraints

## Solution

### Subtask #1 ($n = 1$)

When $n = 1$, it means that there's a single row in the grid. In this case, we can color the cells as follows: color the first $k - 1$ cells with numbers ranging from $1$ to $k - 1$, and assign color $k$ to the remaining $m - k + 1$ cells.

```cpp
vector <vector<int>> color(int n ,int m ,int k)
{
    vector <vector<int>> g(n ,vector<int>(m));
    for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
        if(j + 1 <= k)          //if first k cells
            g[0][j] = j + 1;    //then color j from [1, k]
        else                    //if remaining cells
            g[0][j] = k;        //then color k
    }
    return g;
}
```
</details>

### Subtask #2 ($k = 2$)

When $k = 2$, it means that the grid must contain only $2$ different colors. We can do this by coloring the first row or column with the color $1$, and color the rest of the grid with $2$. This is valid because the removal of a single row or column from the grid preserves its rectangular structure.

You should pay attention to whether you color the first row or the first column with $1$, as either $n$ or $m$ can be equal to $1$. For details, refer to the code below.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
vector <vector<int>> color(int n ,int m ,int k)
{
    vector <vector<int>> g(n ,vector<int>(m ,2)); //whole grid is colored 2
    if(n == 1)                     //grid consists of a single row
        g[0][0] = 1;               //color the first column with 1
    else                           //grid consists of more than one row
        g[0] = vector<int>(m ,1);  //color the first row with 1
    return g;
}
```

### Subtask #3 ($k \le \max(n, m)$)

This subtask is similar to subtask 1. However, unlike subtask 1, we don't color individual cells; rather, we color entire rows or columns with a single color, treating them as if they were individual cells. Also, we choose to color by rows if $n > m$, while we use column coloring otherwise. This ensures that we have space for all $k$ colors.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
vector <vector<int>> color(int n ,int m ,int k)
{
    vector <vector<int>> g(n ,vector<int>(m));
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
        if(n > m)                    //if more rows than columns
            g[i][j] = min(i + 1 ,k); //then color by rows
        else                         //if more columns than rows
            g[i][j] = min(j + 1 ,k); //then color by columns
    }
    return g;
}
```
</details>

### Subtask #4 (Full solution)

For the general solution, we start coloring individual cells in a sequential manner, starting from the top-left corner and moving from left to right and top to bottom. This continues until we have filled a total of $k - 2$ cells. Then, we proceed to color the remaining cells in the current row using the color $k - 1$. As a result, the uncolored portion of the grid now takes on a rectangular shape, which we can then color using the color $k$.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
vector <vector<int>> color(int n ,int m ,int k)
{
    vector <vector<int>> g(n ,vector<int>(m));
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
        g[i][j] = min(m*i+j+1 ,k-1);
        if(m*i+1 >= k || m*i+j+1 == n*m)
            g[i][j] = k;
    }
    return g;
}
```
