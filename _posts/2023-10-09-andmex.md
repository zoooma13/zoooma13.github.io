## Description

### Brief Statement

You are given an array $A$ of length $n$. You can choose a non-negative integer $x$ and replace each element $A_i$ with $A_i\wedge x$ where $\wedge$ denotes the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) operator. 

Find the value of $x$ that maximizes the [minimum excluded value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mex_(mathematics)) in $A$.

### Example

When $n = 6$ and $A = [13, 11, 40, 10, 33, 19]$, we can choose $x = 23$. As a result, $A$ becomes $[13\wedge 23,\, 11\wedge 23,\, 40\wedge 23,10\wedge 23,\, 33\wedge 23,\, 19\wedge 23] = [5,3,0,2,1,19]$ 
which has a minimum excluded value $4$. Another optimal answer is $x = 19$.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 10^5$
* $0 \le A_i \lt 2^{30}$

## Solution

First, a bruteforce approach is to try all possible integer values of $x$ in $[0, 2^{30})$, calculate the $\text{mex}$ of $A$ with this $x$, and select the one that maximizes the $\text{mex}$ value. However, this would be too slow.

Let $y$ be an optimal answer, and $w$ be the smallest non-negative integer for which the $w$-th bit in $y$ is equal to $0$. Notice how after performing the operation on $A$ with $y$, all the integers in $A$ will also be missing the $w$-th bit, so there cannot be integers in $[2^w, 2^{w+1})$, and consequently, the $\text{mex}$ value cannot exceed than $2^w$. This implies that all the bits $i$ where $i \gt w$ plays no role in improving the answer, they can only reduce it. As a result, selecting $x = 2^w-1$ will yield the same $\text{mex}$ as $y$ (assuming $y$ is optimal). 

Therefore, we can narrow our search space to integers in the form of $2^w-1$ for all integers $w$ from $0$ to $30$, ensuring that at least one of them holds the optimal answer.

        int x = (1<<w) - 1;
        
        vector <bool> o(1<<w);
        for(int&i : a)
            o[i & x] = 1;
        
        int mex = find(o.begin() ,o.end() ,0) - o.begin();
        mexx = max(mexx ,{mex, x});
    }
    printf("%d\n",mexx[1]);
}
