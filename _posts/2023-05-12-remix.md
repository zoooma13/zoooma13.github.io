## Description

### Brief Statement

You are given a multiset $S$ consisting of $n$ integers. You should perform the following three-step operation some number of times until a single integer remains in $S$.

1. Choose a multiset $T$ such that $T \subseteq S$ and $\lvert T \rvert \ge 2$.
2. Erase the elements of $T$ from $S$.
3. Insert $\max(T) - \min(T)$ to $S$.

Find a sequence of operations that maximizes the integer left in $S$.

### Example

When $n = 7$ and $S = \\{24, 33, 48, 63, 90, 93, 97\\}$, we can do the following operations:

|       | **Chosen $T$**       | **New $S$**                            | 
|-------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| $0$   |                      | $\\{24, 33, 48, 63, 90, 93, 97\\}$     |
| $1$   | $\\{33, 90, 93\\}$   | $\\{24, 48, \underline{60}, 63, 97\\}$ |
| $2$   | $\\{60, 63\\}$       | $\\{\underline{3}, 24, 48, 97\\}$      |
| $3$   | $\\{24, 48\\}$       | $\\{3, \underline{24}, 97\\}$          |
| $4$   | $\\{3, 24, 97\\}$    | $\\{\underline{94}\\}$                 |

The values underlined in $S$ denote the integer inserted. After the fourth operation, $S$ is reduced to a single integer value of $94$. It can be shown that no other sequence of operations results in a larger value.

### Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 10^5$
* $0 \le S_i \le 10^5$

### Subtasks

1. (10 points): $S_{i+1} = S_i + 1$ (for all $1 \le i \le n - 1$)
2. (40 points): $n \le 100, S_i \le 1000$ (for all $1 \le i \le n$)
3. (50 points): No additional constraints

## Solution

### Observations

1. An operation on set $T$ yields values less than or equal to $\max(T)$. Thus, the maximum achievable value after all operations cannot exceed $\max(S)$.

2. For the final operation on subset $E$, the result is $\max(E) - \min(E)$. To maximize this result, we need to either maximize $\max(E)$ or minimize $\min(E).$ However, since any operation on a subset can only decrease its maximum value (as seen in observation 1), $\max(E)$ optimally originates from the original set $S$, leaving us with the sole option of minimizing $\min(E)$.

3. From observations 1 and 2, we may ignore the scheme of choosing a subset altogether and only focus on choosing the two integral values, $\min(T)$ and $\max(T)$, a subset of size two if you must. Until the final operation, where the final subset $E$ will contain all the remaining elements.

### Subtask #1 ($S$ consists of a consecutive series of numbers)

In this subtask, we basically use the observations mentioned above and do some case analysis. For details, refer to the code below.

    if(n == 2 || s[0] == 0){
        ops.push_back(s); // => max(s) - min(s)
    }
    else if(n == 3){
        ops.push_back({s[0] ,s[1]}); // => 1
        ops.push_back({1 ,s[2]});    // => max(s) - 1
    }
    else if(n == 4){
        if(s[0] == 1){
            ops.push_back({2 ,3}); // => 1
            ops.push_back({1 ,1}); // => 0
            ops.push_back({0 ,4}); // => max(s)
        }

            ops.push_back({s[0] ,s[1]});    // => 1
            ops.push_back({1 ,s[2] ,s[3]}); // => max(s) - 1
        }
    }
    else{

        ops.push_back({s[2] ,s[3]});     // => 1
        ops.push_back({1 ,1});           // => 0
        s.erase(s.begin() ,s.begin()+4);
        s.push_back(0);
        ops.push_back(s);                // => max(s)
    }
 
    printf("%d\n",ops.size());
    for(auto&t : ops){
        printf("%d ",t.size());
        for(auto&i : t)
            printf("%d ",i);
        printf("\n");
    }
}

### Subtask #2 ($n \le 100, S_i \le 1000$)

Let's think of all the non-empty subsets of $S$, and denote $C_i$ as the sum of elements in the $i$-th subset. It's clear that the lower bound for the value of $\min(E)$ is the smallest absolute difference $\lvert C_i - C_j \rvert$ where $i \neq j$. And, luckily, it turns out that there is a constructive approach to achieve this value. 

Let $A$ and $B$ represent the $i$-th and $j$-th subsets for which $\lvert C_i - C_j \rvert$ is minimized. If there are any common elements between these sets, removing them from both sets doesn't affect the value of $\lvert C_i - C_j \rvert$. We then proceed as follows until one of the sets becomes empty:

1. Choose an element $x$ from $A$, an choose any element $y$ from $B$. 
2. Do an operation with the subset $\\{x,y\\}$.
3. Erase $x$ from $A$ and $y$ from $B$.
4. Insert $x - y$ to $A$ if $x$ is greater than $y$, or insert $y - x$ to $B$ otherwise.

Notice that $\lvert \sum A - \sum B \rvert$ remains constant and equal to $\lvert C_i - C_j \rvert$ after each operation. In the end, we will be left with one integer value ($\min(E) = \lvert C_i - C_j \rvert$) within one of the sets. It's worth emphasizing that we end up with **exactly one** integer, not two not more, as having more integers would contradict the minimality of $\lvert C_i - C_j \rvert$. In such a case, we could have removed the extra element(s) and achieved a smaller difference.

For this subtask, it's sufficient to calculate the subsets' sums of $S$ using a simple knapsack dp in $O(n^2\max(S))$.

### Subtask #3 (Full solution)

We need one more observation on top of subtask 2 to solve the full problem. The observation is that the absolute minimum value for $\lvert C_i - C_j \rvert$ is zero, which occurs only when $C_i$ equals $C_j$. 

Given that the multiset values are constrained with a maximum value $M$, we can deduce that any multiset of size exceeding a certain threshold $L$ must contain two non-overlapping subsets with equal sums.

Proof: In a multiset of size $L$, there exists a total of $2^L$ subsets, and the maximum possible sum for any such subset is equal to $LM$. Consequently, if $2^L > LM$, we can apply the pigeonhole principle, which assures the existence of two separate subsets with equal sums. Hence, we can choose the minimum value for $L$ that satisfies this equation. Here, $M = 10^5$, and the smallest $L$ satisfying the equation is $L = 22$. 

Therefore, we can compute all subset sums for any set of $L$ elements naively in $O(2^L)$.

```cpp
const int L = 22;
 
int ps[1<<L];
 
void solve()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    vector <int> s(n);
    for(int&i : s)
        scanf("%d",&i);
    swap(s[--n] ,*max_element(s.begin() ,s.end()));
 
    int sum = 0;
    vector <int> sub{s[0] ,1 ,0};
    for(int i = 1; i < 1<<min(n ,L); i++){
        int j = __builtin_ctz(i) ,mask = i^(i>>1);
        sum += (mask>>j&1? +s[j] : -s[j]);
        if(ps[sum])
            sub = {0 ,mask ,ps[sum]};
        ps[sum] = mask;
    }
    for(int j = 0 ,i = 1; i < 1<<L; i++) if(ps[i]){
        sub = min(sub ,{i-j ,ps[i] ,ps[j]});
        j = i;
    }
 
    vector <int> a ,b ,c{sub[0] ,s[n]};
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if(i >= L || (sub[1]>>i&1) == (sub[2]>>i&1))
            c.push_back(s[i]);
        else if(sub[1]>>i&1)
            a.push_back(s[i]);
        else
            b.push_back(s[i]);
    }
 
    vector <vector <int>> ans;
    while(!a.empty() && !b.empty()){
        ans.push_back({a.back(), b.back()});
        if(a.back() > b.back())
            swap(a ,b);
        b.back() -= a.back();
        a.pop_back();
    }
    ans.push_back(c);
 
    printf("%d\n",ans.size());
    for(auto&t : ans){
        printf("%d ",t.size());
        for(auto&i : t)
            printf("%d ",i);
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```
