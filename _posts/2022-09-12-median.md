## Description

### Brief Statement

You are given two integers $n$ and $k$. Find a permutation of length $n$ such that when we consider all its prefixes, the number of distinct median values within those prefixes is exactly $k$. 

For example, in the permutation $[4, 2, 1, 3, 5]$, there are $5$ prefixes with $3$ distinct median values as follows:

| Prefix            | Sorted Prefix                 | Median Value   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| $[4]$             | $[\underline{4}]$             | $4$            |
| $[4, 2]$          | $[\underline{2}, 4]$          | $2$            |
| $[4, 2, 1]$       | $[1, \underline{2}, 4]$       | $2$            |
| $[4, 2, 1, 3]$    | $[1, \underline{2}, 3, 4]$    | $2$            |
| $[4, 2, 1, 3, 5]$ | $[1, 2, \underline{3}, 4, 5]$ | $3$            |

The median values of the prefixes are $4$, $2$, $2$, $2$, and $3$. Among these values, there are only $3$ distinct: $4$, $2$, and $3$.  

### Example

When $n = 5$ and $k = 3$, a valid permutation is $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ or $[4, 2, 1, 3, 5]$ (explained above).

### Constraints

* $1 \le k \le n \le 10^5$

### Subtasks

1. (10 points) $n \le 8$
2. (40 points) $k = 1$
3. (20 points) $k = n$
4. (30 points) No additional constraints

## Solution

### Subtask #1 ($n \le 8$)

In this subtask, we can use the simplest approach: generate all possible permutations and then evaluate each one to determine the count of distinct median prefixes it yields.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
vector <int> construct(int n ,int k)
{
    vector <int> p(n);
    iota(p.begin() ,p.end() ,1);
    do{
        set <int> dist;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            vector <int> sorted{p.begin() ,p.begin()+i+1};
            sort(sorted.begin() ,sorted.end());
            dist.insert(sorted[i/2]);
        }
        if(dist.size() == k)
            break;
    } while(next_permutation(p.begin() ,p.end()));
    return p;
}
```
</details>

### Subtask #2 ($k = 1$)

When $k = 1$, it implies that all prefixes of the permutation must have a the same median value, which, in this case, must match the first element of the permutation. Additionally, the median of a permutation with a length of $n$ is always $\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor$. Consequently, the first element in the resulting permutation must be $P_1 =\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor$. 

In order to maintain this median value constant while adding more elements, we should follow a pattern: place an integer smaller than $P_1$ in the second position, followed by an integer greater than $P_1$ in the third position, then smaller, greater, and so on. This approach ensures that the median value of the prefixes remains unchanged and consistently equal to $\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor$.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
vector <int> construct(int n ,int k)
{
    int l = 1 ,r = n;
    vector <int> p;
    p.push_back((n+1)/2);
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
        if(i%2 == 0)
            p.push_back(l++);
        else
            p.push_back(r--);
    }
    return p;
}
```
</details>

### Subtask #3 ($k = n$)

When $k = n$, it implies that all prefixes of the permutation must have different median values. We will follow a similar inductive approach like in subtask 3. 

Note that the value $n$ can only be the median of a prefix when that prefix contains a single element. This necessitates placing $n$ at $P_1$. Similarly, $1$ can be the median for a prefix only if it's placed at $P_2$. Consequently, the problem is reduced to constructing a permutation of length $n-2$ of values in $[2, n-1]$. Thus, we follow the same approach: place the largest, followed by the smallest, and solve the new subproblem.

Remarkably, there exists just one permutation that yeilds $n$ distinct median values for its prefixes. To understand why, consider how, at each step of constructing the answer, we were limited to placing only one possible value in the current position.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
vector <int> construct(int n ,int k)
{
    int l = 1 ,r = n;
    vector <int> p;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if(i%2 == 0)
            p.push_back(r--);
        else
            p.push_back(l++);
    }
    return p;
}
```
</details>

### Subtask #4 (Full solution)

Finally, for general values of $k$, we combine the two solutions above: for the first $k-1$ elements we construct the permutation as if $k = n$, and as if $k = 1$ for the rest.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Code</summary>

```cpp
vector <int> construct(int n ,int k)
{
    int l = 1 ,r = n;
    vector <int> p;
    for(int i = 0; i < k-1; i++)
        p.push_back(i&1? l++ : r--);
    p.push_back((n+1)/2);
    for(int i = k; i < n; i++)
        p.push_back(i&1? r-- : l++);
    return p;
}
```
</details>
